This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing the impact of facility expansion on obstetric deserts across the United States. Obstetric deserts are regions with limited or no access to maternity care, and this project aims to provide a data-driven approach to assess and improve healthcare accessibility for women.

Leveraging descriptive analytics, data modeling, and visualizations, the final tool—a Tableau dashboard—offers a comprehensive view of maternity care access across the nation. The project uses data from over 5 million women to assess healthcare gaps and supports informed policy decision-making.

**Key Features**

**Data Source**: The analysis incorporates data from over 5 million women, providing a robust foundation for insights on healthcare access, utilizing a large dataset of women’s healthcare information, along with demographic census and obstetric health care data .
**Descriptive Analytics**: Design and execution of a descriptive analytics solution to analyze the effectiveness of healthcare facility expansion in reducing obstetric deserts
**Data Modeling**: Developed optimization models to evaluate maternity care access across various regions.
Interactive Tableau Dashboard: Created a Tableau dashboard that visualizes maternity care access across the U.S., helping stakeholders understand healthcare coverage gaps. The dashboard allows users to filter and explore data by different criteria, such as region, population density, and access to care.

**Research Contribution**
This project is part of the ongoing research led by Dr. Lauren Steimle at Georgia Tech, titled "Mathematical Modeling of Obstetric Unit Closures: From the Descriptive to the Prescriptive." The work was presented at the Harvard Center for Research on Computation and Society, contributing to healthcare policy discussions and interventions aimed at improving maternity care accessibility.

**Use Case**
The Tableau dashboard is designed for healthcare policymakers, researchers, and public health organizations. It serves as a decision-making tool to:

Future Work
Prescriptive Modeling: Moving from descriptive analytics to prescriptive solutions, identifying optimal locations for new maternity care facilities.
Expansion to Other Healthcare Domains: Applying the same framework to analyze healthcare access in other critical areas beyond maternity care.
